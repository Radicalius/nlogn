      "desc": "I felt like HeyTaco!, a teambuilding Slack Bot, would be a great fit for my coop.  However, there was no freely available version of the bot for Rocket.Chat, a self-hosted Slack alternative which my coop was plaaning on using.  So I decided to try to write my own bot in ruby.  This article describes its implementation.",

To get better results, I scraped some prominent job boards and applied my own filters.  This article describes how my scraper works and how it could be improved.",

I recently discovered that it is possible to make simple graphical user interfaces with discord chat bots.  By exploiting chat reactions, message editing, and embeds, one can create rudimentary buttons.  In this tutorial, we will implement a bot that displays server status for a set of servers. \n",
